# Parser Path Optimization

## Overview

The 0.4.0 release introduces three groups of internal optimizations to the Rust
HTML-to-Markdown converter. These optimizations reduce unnecessary work during
DOM traversal and output normalization without changing the converter's public
API, FFI surface, or operator-facing behavior.

The three optimization groups are:

1. **Noise Region Early Pruning** — Skips child-node traversal for elements
   that produce no meaningful Markdown output (`<script>`, `<style>`,
   `<noscript>`), with experimental support for semantic noise regions
   (`<nav>`, `<footer>`, `<aside>`) behind a compile-time feature flag.
2. **Simple Structure Fast Path** — Pre-scans the DOM to detect structurally
   simple documents and enables branch elimination during traversal for
   qualifying pages.
3. **Large Response Path Optimization** — Pre-allocates the output buffer based
   on input size and replaces the two-pass normalize-then-copy with a
   single-pass fused normalizer for documents exceeding the large-body
   threshold.

All optimizations are evidence-gated: each group must demonstrate measurable
benefit in the benchmark corpus and pass a corpus diff before merging.

## Evidence Status

Evidence collection for the 0.4.0 optimizations is pending. Before this
feature ships as a release claim, the following evidence must be gathered and
recorded here:

- **Benchmark results**: Latency measurements (p50, p95, p99) and output byte
  counts for each optimization group, compared against the pre-optimization
  baseline on the same corpus version and platform.
- **Corpus diff summary**: Full-corpus diff confirming output equivalence for
  well-formed content (no unexplainable differences).
- **Peak memory comparison**: Before/after peak RSS for representative large
  documents to confirm no memory regression.

Until this evidence is collected and reviewed, the optimizations are considered
internal implementation improvements, not a release-level performance claim.

## Architecture

All 0.4.0 optimizations operate within the existing buffer-based conversion
pipeline. They do not introduce streaming, chunk-driven parsing, or parser
replacement. The html5ever parsing phase (step 1) is untouched.

### Current pipeline

```
HTML bytes → parse_html() (html5ever) → RcDom
           → SecurityValidator checks
           → MarkdownConverter::convert() → traverse_node() / handle_element_internal()
           → normalize_output()
           → final Markdown string
```

### Integration points

| Optimization Group | Integration Point | What Changes |
|--------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| Noise Region Early Pruning | `handle_element_internal` in `converter/traversal.rs` | Early-return before `traverse_children` for prunable elements |
| Simple Structure Fast Path | `convert_with_context` in `converter.rs` | Pre-scan qualification gate before traversal begins |
| Large Response Path | `convert_with_context` in `converter.rs` | Buffer pre-allocation and fused normalization after traversal |

### Module layout

All optimization code lives within the `converter` module hierarchy:

```
components/rust-converter/src/
  converter.rs                    # convert(), convert_with_context()
  converter/
    pruning.rs                    # Noise region pruning logic
    fast_path.rs                  # Fast path qualification
    large_response.rs             # Buffer estimation and fused normalizer
    traversal.rs                  # traverse_node, handle_element_internal (modified)
```


## Optimization Group 1: Noise Region Early Pruning

### What it does

During DOM traversal, the converter checks each element's tag name against a
pruning list before visiting its children. Elements on the list are skipped
immediately, avoiding the cost of recursing into their subtrees.

For `<script>`, `<style>`, and `<noscript>`, the `SecurityValidator` already
removes these elements (they are in `DANGEROUS_ELEMENTS`). The pruning
optimization makes this explicit at the traversal layer and avoids visiting
child text nodes that would produce no output regardless.

For `<nav>`, `<footer>`, and `<aside>`, pruning skips the entire subtree
(element and all descendants). This is disabled by default in 0.4.0.

### Elements targeted

| Element | Decision | Behavior | Default in 0.4.0 |
|---------|----------|----------|-------------------|
| `<script>` | `SkipChildren` | Skip child nodes; element itself already removed by `SecurityValidator` | Active |
| `<style>` | `SkipChildren` | Skip child nodes; CSS content never produces Markdown | Active |
| `<noscript>` | `SkipChildren` | Skip child nodes; fallback content is redundant | Active |
| `<nav>` | `SkipSubtree` | Skip element and all descendants | Disabled (feature flag) |
| `<footer>` | `SkipSubtree` | Skip element and all descendants | Disabled (feature flag) |
| `<aside>` | `SkipSubtree` | Skip element and all descendants | Disabled (feature flag) |

All other elements return `Traverse` and are handled normally.

### Pruning rules

- Pruning decisions are based on tag name only. No attribute inspection, no
  content heuristics, no `role` attribute matching.
- The `RcDom` tree is never mutated. Pruning operates at the traversal layer
  by returning early from `handle_element_internal`.
- For `SkipChildren`: the element node itself is processed (though
  `SecurityValidator` removes it), but its children are never visited.
- For `SkipSubtree`: the element and its entire subtree are skipped.
- For elements not in the pruning list, the decision is deterministic:
  `Traverse`. There is no ambiguity state.

### Feature flag: `prune_noise_regions`

Semantic noise region pruning (`<nav>`, `<footer>`, `<aside>`) is gated behind
the `prune_noise_regions` Cargo feature flag. In 0.4.0 release builds, this
feature is disabled by default. It can be enabled at compile time for
benchmarking and corpus diff collection:

```bash
cargo test --features prune_noise_regions
```

Promotion to default-on requires benchmark evidence demonstrating clear benefit
with acceptable false-kill risk, reviewed during a future release cycle.

### Known limitations

- `<div role="navigation">` and similar attribute-based semantic regions are
  not detected. Only the six tag names listed above are recognized.
- When `prune_noise_regions` is enabled, pages that place primary content
  inside `<nav>`, `<footer>`, or `<aside>` elements will lose that content
  (false kill). This is a known trade-off and the reason the feature is
  disabled by default.
- Pruning runs before `SecurityValidator::check_element` for prunable
  elements. This is safe because `script`/`style`/`noscript` are already in
  `DANGEROUS_ELEMENTS`, and `nav`/`footer`/`aside` are not dangerous.

## Optimization Group 2: Simple Structure Fast Path

### What it does

Before traversal begins, the converter performs a lightweight pre-scan of the
DOM tree. If every element node uses a tag in the allowed set and the maximum
nesting depth stays below the threshold, the document qualifies for the fast
path.

The fast path is a qualification gate, not a separate converter. Qualifying
documents use the same `traverse_node` code path, but the converter can
eliminate unreachable branches during traversal (e.g., table handling, form
control handling, embedded content handling are unreachable for fast-path
documents). `SecurityValidator` remains fully active.

If any unsupported node is found during the pre-scan, the entire document falls
back to the normal path. There is no partial fast path.

### Qualification criteria

A document qualifies when both conditions are met:

1. Every element node uses a tag in the `FAST_PATH_ELEMENTS` set, or is a
   prunable element (handled by `should_prune` returning non-`Traverse`).
2. The maximum DOM nesting depth does not exceed `FAST_PATH_MAX_DEPTH` (15).

Non-element nodes (text, comments, doctypes, processing instructions) are
always allowed.

### Allowed elements

| Category | Elements |
|----------|----------|
| Document structure | `html`, `head`, `body` |
| Headings | `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `h4`, `h5`, `h6` |
| Block content | `p`, `br`, `hr`, `blockquote`, `pre` |
| Lists | `ul`, `ol`, `li` |
| Inline formatting | `strong`, `b`, `em`, `i`, `code` |
| Links and images | `a`, `img` |
| Containers | `div`, `span`, `section`, `article`, `main`, `header` |

### Disqualifying elements (examples)

Tables (`table`, `thead`, `tbody`, `tr`, `td`, `th`), forms (`form`, `input`,
`select`, `textarea`, `button`), embedded content (`iframe`, `object`,
`embed`), and media (`video`, `audio`, `source`, `track`, `area`, `map`) all
disqualify a document from the fast path.

### Depth threshold

The maximum nesting depth is 15 (`FAST_PATH_MAX_DEPTH`). This covers typical
article structures. Deeply nested documents likely have complex structures that
benefit from the full conversion path.

Depth is counted from the document root node (depth 0). A text node inside
`<html><body><div><p>text</p></div></body></html>` sits at depth 5.

### Known limitations

- The pre-scan walks the entire DOM tree, adding O(n) overhead. For documents
  that do not qualify, this is wasted work. In practice, the scan is
  lightweight (tag-name comparison only) and terminates early on the first
  disqualifying node.
- The allowed element set is intentionally conservative. Some elements that
  could be handled by the fast path (e.g., `<dl>`, `<dt>`, `<dd>`) are
  excluded to keep the qualification logic simple.
- The fast path does not skip `SecurityValidator` checks. It reduces branch
  overhead in the traversal, not security validation.

  enum, `qualifies` function, `FAST_PATH_ELEMENTS` list, `FAST_PATH_MAX_DEPTH`

  `convert_with_context`

## Optimization Group 3: Large Response Path Optimization

### What it does

When the traversal output exceeds a size threshold, this optimization replaces
the two-pass normalize-then-copy pattern with a single-pass fused normalizer.
This eliminates one O(n) allocation and copy for the normalization result.

The optimization targets the normalization phase (after traversal), not the
traversal itself. The initial traversal buffer uses a fixed 1 KB pre-allocation
for all documents; smarter pre-allocation based on input HTML size is deferred
because the `RcDom` does not expose the original byte count without an
additional tree walk.

### Buffer estimation for the fused normalizer

When the fused normalizer is activated, its output buffer is pre-allocated
using `estimate_output_capacity`, which estimates the normalized output at 40%
of the traversal output size (`OUTPUT_SIZE_ESTIMATE_FACTOR = 0.4`), clamped to
\[4 KB, 4 MB\]:

| Traversal Output Size | Normalizer Buffer Capacity |
|-----------------------|---------------------------|
| < ~10 KB | 4 KB (minimum) |
| ~10 KB – ~10 MB | `output_size × 0.4` |
| > ~10 MB | 4 MB (maximum) |

Note: the estimate is based on the traversal output size (intermediate
Markdown), not the input HTML size. This is a pragmatic choice — the input
byte count is not available from the `RcDom` without a separate walk.

### Fused normalizer

The `FusedNormalizer` struct replaces the two-pass normalize-then-copy pattern
for large documents. It applies normalization rules incrementally as each line
is appended:

- Tracks fenced code block state (`` ``` `` delimiters).
- Collapses consecutive blank lines to a single blank line.
- Trims trailing whitespace from each line.
- Normalizes inline whitespace (collapses multiple spaces) outside code blocks,
  while preserving leading indentation and content inside backtick spans.

The output produced by `FusedNormalizer` is identical to the output of
`MarkdownConverter::normalize_output` for the same input. This equivalence is
verified by property-based tests.

### Threshold

The fused normalizer activates when the traversal output (intermediate
Markdown) exceeds `LARGE_BODY_THRESHOLD` (256 KB, a hardcoded constant in
`converter.rs`). This threshold is checked against the traversal output length
after `traverse_node_with_context` completes — not against the input HTML size.

The 256 KB value is chosen to match the order of magnitude of the
`markdown_large_body_threshold` NGINX directive default, though the two values
measure different things (the directive controls input HTML size; the constant
controls intermediate output size). Documents below the threshold use the
standard `normalize_output` two-pass approach.

### Known limitations

- The fused normalizer processes the traversal output line-by-line after
  traversal completes. It does not interleave with traversal itself — the
  intermediate `output` string is still fully built before normalization
  begins. The saving is one O(n) allocation and copy, not the traversal cost.
- The initial traversal buffer uses a fixed 1 KB pre-allocation for all
  documents. Smarter pre-allocation based on input HTML size would require
  walking the DOM to estimate byte count, which is deferred.
- Buffer estimation uses a fixed 0.4 factor applied to the traversal output
  size (not the input HTML size). Pages with unusually high or low
  HTML-to-Markdown compression ratios may over- or under-allocate, but the
  clamp bounds prevent pathological cases.
- The threshold is a hardcoded constant, not configurable via NGINX directives.
  It is not the same as `markdown_large_body_threshold` (which controls input
  HTML size limits), though both use 256 KB as a default.
- `ConversionContext` timeout checks remain active throughout the large-response
  path. The fused normalizer does not bypass timeout enforcement.

  `estimate_output_capacity` function, `FusedNormalizer` struct
- `components/rust-converter/src/converter.rs` — integration in
  `convert_with_context`

## Security Baseline

All `SecurityValidator` checks remain active regardless of which optimization
path is taken:

- Dangerous element removal (`script`, `style`, `noscript`, and others in
  `DANGEROUS_ELEMENTS`)
- Event handler attribute stripping (`on*` prefix)
- Dangerous URL detection (`javascript:`, `data:`, etc.)
- DOM depth validation

Pruning `<script>`, `<style>`, and `<noscript>` earlier is security-positive —
it avoids visiting their children, which the security validator would remove
anyway. Pruning `<nav>`, `<footer>`, `<aside>` is a content decision, not a
security decision; these elements are not in `DANGEROUS_ELEMENTS`.

No new `unsafe` code is introduced by any optimization in this spec.

## Stop Line

Optimization work stops and remaining ideas defer to 0.5.x when any of the
following conditions are met:

- The optimization requires changes to the FFI boundary
- The optimization alters the `MarkdownConverter` public API
- The optimization restructures the DOM traversal model
- The optimization introduces conditional compilation paths that fragment the
  conversion logic
- The optimization work threatens the 0.4.0 release timeline
- The optimization depends on unfinished benchmark tooling
- The optimization creates ambiguity about output stability

P0 specs always take priority. If this P1 spec risks the release, it defers
entirely rather than shipping a partial optimization set.

## Deferred to 0.5.x

The following items are explicitly out of scope for 0.4.0:

- **Streaming/chunk-driven conversion** — Requires fundamental architecture
  changes to the buffer-based pipeline.
- **Parser replacement** — Replacing html5ever or markup5ever_rcdom with a
  different parser/DOM library.
- **Content-aware heuristic pruning** — Readability-style algorithms that
  analyze content to decide what to prune.
- **Configurable pruning rules** — Operator-facing directives to control which
  elements are pruned.
- **Optimization of the html5ever parsing phase** — Step 1 of the pipeline is
  untouched.
- **Promotion of semantic pruning to default-on** — `<nav>`, `<footer>`,
  `<aside>` pruning remains behind a feature flag until evidence and rollout
  posture support promotion.
- **New NGINX configuration directives** for optimization control.
- **Optimization-specific metrics or logging** — No new reason codes or
  decision logging for optimization paths.
