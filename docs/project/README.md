# Project Documentation

This directory contains project-level status and maintenance-oriented documentation.

## Contents

- [PROJECT_STATUS.md](PROJECT_STATUS.md) - current implementation and validation status (aligned to code and recent verification)

## Historical / Process Documentation

Historical planning and process documents should be moved to `../archive/` when they are no longer maintained as current guidance.

Current local archive example:

- `../archive/project-history/IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md` (historical roadmap snapshot; not source of truth for current status)
