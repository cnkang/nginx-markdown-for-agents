"""The Release Gate must upload the fuzz qualification record on failure too.

The record and the per-target raw logs are the only post-mortem evidence
when the fuzz qualification fails; the workflow's other upload steps sit on
success paths, so this step is asserted to be unconditional (``if:
always()``) and to point at the paths the validator actually writes.  The
paths are taken from the validator's own constants, so renaming a record
path without updating the workflow fails here.
